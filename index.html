									<!--
									<p>I have a passion for optimization and efficiency, as well as a strong interest in product management, project management, and data analytics. I strive to improve both myself and the processes around me, and would like to grow my career in Product Management. Take a minute to access my résumé via the panel on the right!<br/> <br/>I am a Kitchener native and a passionate Canadian. I have driven across every province in Canada and would like to take the time to experience the territories. My interests include automobiles, snowboarding, football, rockclimbing, and investing. 10 years ago, I purchased a Jeep with my own money made from buying and selling various items on Kijiji. Over the years, hundreds of hours of work and care have been put into it in order to maintain it's legacy. I have snowboarded for 8 years and would love to go to Whistler next year. The stock market is of great interest to me, and I am constantly learning and studying trends, strategies, and markets. I love learning new things and being given new opportunities.</p>
